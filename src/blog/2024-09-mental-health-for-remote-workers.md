The COVID-19 pandemic introduced much of the world to the highs and lows of remote work. Depending on what articles you were reading, remote work was either the holy grail of work/life balance or an isolated, nightmarish breeding ground for depression and anxiety.

At Hey Nova, we're proud to be a remote-forever company, but we know that no work situation is flawless. What are the benefits and drawbacks to a remote setup, and how can we make it work for our brains instead of against them?

## Pros

### Flexibility

A flexible schedule is one of the biggest benefits drawing people to remote work. Instead of struggling with standard 9-5 schedules, many remote jobs let you work when you choose. You can customize your hours based on your energy levels and your other commitments, reducing the stress of conflicting schedules.

### More time for mental-health improving activities

Commuting to work can be a major time sink. While some remote employees might choose to go to a co-working space or a secondary work location, they always have the choice to cut the commute entirely and work from home. This leaves more time for wellness management activities like:

- Getting enough sleep
- Taking breaks during work sessions
- Short breathing and mindfulness exercises
- Physical health activities like stretching, exercise, and cooking nourishing meals
- Time with family or friends

### Increased Comfort

With its unspoken rules, body language expectations, and at times, confusing social etiquette, office jobs can be pretty stressful, especially for workers who are neurodivergent or socially anxious. Virtual meetings and independent work spaces can ease the pressure to fit into typical in-person social norms.

Remote work can also help reduce mental strain by letting everyone create the most comfortable and productive work environment for themselves. Music? No music? Working at your desk vs the kitchen table? Each worker is free to decide the best work environment for them and change things up if it's not working.

## Cons

### Isolation

In an office job, you'll typically share a workspace with coworkers or at least interact with them regularly. But with a remote job, some days, it's just you and your laptop against the world. That can get lonely, and according to U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, it can even get dangerous:

> Loneliness is far more than just a bad feelingâ€”it harms both individual and societal health. It is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, stroke, depression, anxiety, and premature death."
>
> This doesn't mean that remote work is an automatic recipe for bad health, but remote workers often need to take extra care to meet their needs for connection in the absence of an office.

### Work-life balance

A two-second commute from your bed to your desk might sound like a dream, but working and living in the same space can blur the line between personal and work life.

When home becomes work, remote workers might feel pressure to be "on" at all times: always available for meetings, answering messages, or getting ahead on tasks. Work can easily spill into personal time and put employees at risk of burnout from overworking.

[A Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2023/07/03/how-remote-work-can-impact-employees-mental-health/?sh=2397ac772cf0) mentioned that remote employees might not take complete breaks during work, instead using "break" times for household tasks like chores or childcare responsibilities. These employees are still at risk of burnout because they're essentially always working.

### Distractions

With phones, chores, video games, family care, friends, and pets all within arms reach, home can come with a lot of distractions that a typical office wouldn't have. Remote workers might struggle to focus, risking frustration and self-doubt from feeling incapable to complete tasks.

### Managing your mental health while working remote

We at Hey Nova wouldn't trade the flexibility of remote work for anything, but any working situation can be tough on your mental health. As for what to do about it, both individual employees and organizations can take steps to manage remote-work-related mental health stressors.

Individual workers can try the following:

- If loneliness is creeping in, consider a co-working space with either a coworker or someone else you know who works remotely
- Maintain connections with your friends and family
- Take at least a 10-minute break every hour to refresh your mind. Make sure to do something that re-energizes you (ex. a short nap or a walk) rather than doing more work
- Set boundaries between work and your personal life by providing set times where coworkers can contact you

Remote employers can support their workers' mental health too:

- Respect your employees' personal time by only contacting them during their working hours
- Make sure employees know about mental health benefits available to them
- Encourage employees to use their breaks and vacation days to recharge
- Set up opportunities for employees to talk to each other both about work and their lives outside of work. Small, manageable moments of connection can prevent social isolation, improve collaboration, and build team bonds without overburdening socially anxious or neurodivergent workers
- If any of your workers live near other, the occasional in-person get-together can be a great way to connect.

Remote work affects everyone's mental health differently. It will take a few tries to find what works, but the right strategies can completely revamp your relationship to your mental health.
