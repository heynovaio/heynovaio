Look, we know the legal stuff is never fun, but it’s important to cover nonetheless. As much as we love to believe this recent drive towards web accessibility is purely from the goodness of peoples’ hearts, in all truth, the laws are what push this matter forward and keep it at the forefront of businesses’ minds!

When speaking or [writing about accessibility legislation](https://heynova.io/blog/know-your-aoda-whats-happening-in-2021/), we generally default to referencing the [_Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act_ (AODA)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/05a11). This isn’t intentionally an Ontario-centric approach, but just a case of familiarity from the _AODA_ leading the charge. Since caring, compassionate web-oriented folks work with clients all across Canada, this seemed like a great opportunity to discuss what’s being done to remove barriers and improve digital accessibility from coast to coast.

**First, a disclaimer**: We are not legal experts. The summaries below are based on provincial documentation and reporting from news organizations and advocacy groups.

## British Columbia

Let’s start on the west coast, in beautiful British Columbia, where **Hey Nova** was founded and got its start in the realm of accessibility. Currently, the province has ongoing “accessibility initiatives” rather than specific laws, including _[The Accessibility Action Plan](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/accessibility)_, which outlines the goal to make internet access in B.C. the [most accessible and inclusive in all of Canada by 2024](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/about-the-bc-government/accessible-bc/accessibility-2024/docs/accessibility2024_update_web.pdf), starting with the [_British Columbia Accessibility Act_ (M 219)](https://www.leg.bc.ca/parliamentary-business/legislation-debates-proceedings/41st-parliament/3rd-session/bills/first-reading/m219-1) that they kicked off in 2018.

It’s a big objective to strive for when they are currently a few years behind other provinces in the legislation, but we are all for the effort and hope they succeed in this. If this is your first time hearing of it, the act is intended to make B.C. "the most progressive province in Canada for people with disabilities" extending far beyond just web accessibility, with broad coverage of public spaces, transportation, income and employment, internet service, housing, and more. On the digital front, the proposed rules are in line with [**WCAG 2.0 Level AA**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), similar to most legislation throughout Canada.

In 2020, the [province released a report on the public consultation efforts](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/accessibility/background/disability-consultation-process) throughout 2019.

As it isn’t currently a law it is still unclear what fines and other mechanisms the act will put in place to encourage businesses to comply. As we all know, money talks, so perhaps they will realize this and use that to push this initiative into full action.

Just a quick shout out⁠—like any accessibility legislation across the globe, this progress would not be made without the tireless work of [advocacy groups like **Barrier-Free BC⁠**](http://www.asicbc.ca/Pages/Barrier-Free-BC---What's-Your-Barrier.aspx) — so thank you to them!

## Alberta

The next stop on our tour is wild rose country. At the time of writing this, Alberta does not have any accessibility laws planned or in progress, however it does have a human rights act in place, which [explicitly forbids discrimination based on disability](https://www.albertahumanrights.ab.ca/publications/bulletins_sheets_booklets/sheets/protected_grounds/Pages/mental_or_physical_disabilities.aspx). It’s a start, but we want to see more, Alberta!

## Saskatchewan

Here come the prairies and land of the living skies. Saskatchewan, like neighbouring Alberta, does not appear to have any accessibility legislation in the works - beyond a similar [human rights commission](https://saskatchewanhumanrights.ca/education-resources/information-sheets/accessibility-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/).

## Manitoba

Friendly Manitoba is up next. Not to be ignored, this province is making headway, introducing _[The Accessibility for Manitobans Act](https://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/a001-7e.php)_ in 2013, with a [commitment "to achieve significant progress by 2023"](https://accessibilitymb.ca/law.html).

The act draws five key elements for setting accessibility standards, including customer service, employment, communications, public spaces, and transportation. While the larger act is in place, the pieces are still under development. The [**Information and Communications Standards Development Committee** held public consultation sessions as recently as 2019](https://accessibilitymb.ca/standard-for-info-and-comms.html), and is [building digital guidelines based on **WCAG 2.1**](http://accessibilitymb.ca/pdf/discussion_doc_on_ic_standard.pdf). This is a noted jump from other jurisdictions' legislation based on the older **2.0** version - which leaves out [key considerations for smaller screens, touch devices, and other widely used technology](https://www.accessiblemetrics.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-wcag-2-0-and-wcag-2-1/). Good work, Manitoba, we will be watching your progress.

## Ontario

Ontario might be yours to discover, but the province's accessibility legislation has been loud and clear since the _[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act](https://www.ontario.ca/page/about-accessibility-laws#section-1)_ was enacted in 2005. Considered a landmark across Canada, the _AODA_ has helped set the standard for other provinces to build their own laws.

The act established the tone for encouraging compliance, rather than punishing failure, by introducing a [progressive reporting, remediation window, and fine system](https://www.aoda.ca/aoda-administrative-monetary-penalties-scheme-%E2%80%93-three-strikes-you%E2%80%99re-out/). While this can be slower to force change than a lawsuit-based system (such as the _Americans with Disabilities Act_), it has been much less [fierce and damaging](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/07/dominos-pizza-website-accessibility-supreme-court-wont-hear-case/3904582002/) for Ontario businesses.

Having worked with many Ontario businesses, **Hey Nova** can account for its effectiveness as businesses strive to meet 2021’s new deadlines.

## Quebec

_La belle province_ was actually one of the first provinces to enact an accessibility legislation in 1978 with the _“[Act to secure [persons with disabilities] in the exercise of their rights](http://quebec-accessible.ca/en/index.php/resources/laws/canada/quebec/quebec-law-1978/)”_. Not content with the original law, or apparently the brevity of its name, Quebec updated it with the _“[Act to secure [persons with disabilities] in the exercise of their rights with a view to achieving social, school and workplace integration](http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/E-20.1)”_ in 2004.

[Advocacy groups in the province have been calling for a stronger bill](http://quebec-accessible.ca/en/index.php/resources/laws/canada/quebec/quebec-law-2004/), pointing out that the current version only applies to the public sector and "lacks teeth" in enforcing its requirements.

Interestingly, the 2004 law's standards for online content came from the province's own custom guidelines, the [_Standard sur l'accessibilité des sites Web_ (SGQRI 008 2.0)](https://www.tresor.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/PDF/ressources_informationnelles/AccessibiliteWeb/standard-access-web.pdf). This was later dropped in favour of **WCAG 2.0** as of 2018.

## New Brunswick

Continuing Eastward, we enter the loyalist province, which has no active or publicly in-progress legislation. Like Alberta and Saskatchewan, New Brunswick leans on its [human rights laws to cover discrimination](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/hrc-cdp/PDF/Guideline-Accommodating-Disability-at-Work-New-Brunswick.pdf).

## Nova Scotia

Our tour continues with Canada’s ocean playground. In 2017, Nova Scotia passed [Bill 59, _An Act Respecting Accessibility in Nova Scotia_](https://www.nslegislature.ca/legc/bills/62nd_3rd/3rd_read/b059.htm). This makes the province the third in Canada to enact legislation that requires accessibility improvements from the private sector as well as public - after Ontario and Manitoba. However, the full scope of the accessibility law is still being flushed out while they leave the plan open to the public consultation. The [_Access by Design 2030_](https://novascotia.ca/accessibility/access-by-design/) initiative outlines an effort to build a sustainable and functional legal framework that will help them achieve an accessible Nova Scotia by 2030.

While the law's digital accessibility requirements have not yet been set, the [provincial government's own website has been rebuilt to meet **WCAG 2.0 Level AA**](https://novascotia.ca/accessibility/plan/). Nice work, Nova Scotia. A bronze medal is better than nothing!

## Prince Edward Island

We’re nearing the Eastern edge now with the birthplace of confederation. Sadly, PEI does not have accessibility legislation on the books, but public websites such as the [provincial government](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/executive-council-office/website-accessibility-policy) and [courts](https://www.courts.pe.ca/accessibility), do strive to meet **WCAG 2.0 Level A**. Not perfect, but this is a start.

As with other provinces, there is a **[PEI Human Rights Commission](https://www.peihumanrights.ca)** and [active accessibility advocacy organizations](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-accessible-canada-act-carroll-1.4717665#:~:text=A%20bill%20tabled%20this%20week%20in%20Ottawa%2C%20designed%20to%20"identify,in%20Canada%2C%20says%20the%20P.E.I.&text=Bill%20C-81%2C%20the%20Accessible,that%20fall%20under%20federal%20jurisdiction.) such as the **[PEI Council of People with Disabilities](https://www.peicod.pe.ca)**.

## Newfoundland and Labrador

Next comes the rock, the Easternmost end of the great white North. Newfoundland and Labrador has some accessibility legislation, including the [_Buildings Accessibility Act_](https://www.releases.gov.nl.ca/releases/2017/servicenl/1023n01.aspx) introduced in 2017. The act includes key requirements around [parking, washrooms, signage, ramps, and specific rules for apartment buildings](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/accessibility-regulation-ammendments-1.4366899).

Unfortunately, the province has not yet brought a digital-focused accessibility proposal to the table, despite [pressure from advocacy groups like **Barrier-Free Newfoundland and Labrador**](https://www.aoda.ca/legislation-would-move-the-needle-on-accessibility-in-n-l-advocate/). We’d love to see better, but sadly, we do not make the laws.

## Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon

Heading North West, let's touch on Canada’s Arctic. Currently, none of the three territories have active or proposed accessibility legislation on the books. There are signs, however, that the federal government's [_Accessible Canada Act_ could inspire meaningful progress](https://www.yukon-news.com/news/yukon-should-have-accessibility-legislation-yacl-president/) alongside on-the-ground advocacy, so we’ll keep our fingers crossed for that one.

## Honourable mention: Federal legislation

While digging into each province and territory's laws related to accessibility, many references to using the [_Accessible Canada Act_](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-0.6/) as a basis came up. According to a [handy summary on the government of Canada's website](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-people-disabilities/act-summary.html) (including an ASL version), the Minister of Science and Sport and Persons with Disabilities, Kirsty Duncan "consulted with Canadians from July 2016 to February 2017 to find out what an accessible Canada means to them". Following the consultation period, Bill C-81 or _An Act to ensure a barrier-free Canada_, was introduced in parliament in 2018 and came into effect in 2019.

At this time, the act applies to federally regulated banks, broadcasting, telecommunications, and transportation sectors, along with the military and RCMP. No clear requirements for digital compliance have yet been defined, but [they are likely to follow the same federal standard of **WCAG 2.0 Level AA**](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/guidance-implementing-standard-web-accessibility.html).
